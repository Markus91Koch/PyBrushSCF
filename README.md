# PyBrushSCF

PyBrushSCF is a Python implementation of the Scheutjens-Fleer self-consitent field method [1] for the purpose of creating polymer brushes with various special modifications.
From the self-consitent solution it is possible to extract meaningful descriptors of the polymer brush, e.g. total monomer density, single monomer distributions (typically for end monomers)and free energies. An attractive interaction between the end monomers of the brush chains and the grafting surface can be activated. Additionally, it is possible to embded a test chain (or minority chain) into a given polymer brush, make them adsorption-attractive, and extract characteristic properties.

## Planned Extensions

- Adsorption-attractive copolymers
- Bidispersity or general polydispersity of the brush or of the minority chains (Schulz-Zimm distribution)
- Further performance optimizatins

This code is based on a Fortran95 Code developed by my coworker Dirk Romeis.
